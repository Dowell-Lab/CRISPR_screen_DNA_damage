Scripts in this directory were used for evaluating, trimming, and mapping raw fastq files, then sorting guides and barcodes to generate files that contain read counts for each guide pair in each sample. Software versions are listed in relevant Slurm scripts, and all Python scripts used version 3.6.3. All basal screen biological samples were sequenced five times and thus have five separate associated technical replicate fastq files, while irradiated samples were only sequenced once. All fastq files were processed separately through the initial steps and initial sorting. Afterward, guide pair counts were combined within each biological replicate and then into full count tables.

As grna2 was at the end of R2 and yielded poor data that largely did not map, all downstream analysis was conducted using the `full_grna_processing_grna1only.sbatch` pipeline, however the pipeline including grna2 has been included for completeness.
